    <h1>Reflection</h1>

    <h2>Learn from other website</h2>

    <p>This is the first time I build and design a website, which is a challenging but also exiting process.
        Although I have visited countless websites in my daily life, I didn't feel like I had much of an idea when I started designing my own site. 
        At that moment, I suddenly remembered a novelist's website that I had visited before (click the image below to visit the website). I thought I might be able to draw some inspiration from her site, as both of our websites are about showing our personal works. 
    </p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="Images/website.gif" alt="Image failed to load" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>

    <p>I did learn a lot from her website. I found there is a background picture nicely integrated with the navigation at the top section of the website. It displays fiction works using large images rather than wordy text. The overall style and the color scheme fit well with the theme of the website - horror fiction. 
        So I then incorporated these features in the design of my own website. I made a background picture using some screenshots of my videos and put it on the top area of my website. The home page of my website also displays my video works using images of the videos' posters rather than text. 
    </p>

    <h2>Enhanced Interactivity</h2>

    <p>I keep finding things that are important to website design in the process. The first point I'd like to talk about is interactivity. From my personal experience, it's easy to get bored of websites with only a lot of text, because I can do nothing but read. 
        Therefore, to prevent my visitors from getting bored, I added some elements that can give visitors some responses when they click them or hover on it. The page that talks about how to shoot as a professional is just an example. I introduces some concepts or theories in this page, which may seems boring to some visitors. 
        So I decided to use a flip card and an expanding gird to provide some examples because both of the two elements require actions from visitors, thus enhancing the interactivity of my website.
    </p>

    <h2>Theme Color</h2>

    <p>The second point is about theme color. Rich colors can not always present things that look as good as rainbow, and I found this is especially true when it comes to web design. When I haven't decided the theme color for my website, I tried to use many different colors in different areas of my website, but the effect looks messy and cheap. 
        Later, I decided that I would only use green and yellow on the elements of my website, so subtitles, buttons, navigation, etc. are all green or yellow in color. I chose the two colors because I think they convey a sense of positivity like plants and sunshine. I hope that my website and my videos can also make people feel positive.
    </p>

    <h2>W3school and Creativity</h2>

    <p>There are also some aspects in which I think my website are not good enough and one of them is creativity. Creativity is very important for websites that show some art-related works to others. If the site itself is not creative enough, how can the works displayed on it attract the attentions of others? 
        I think my website is still following a traditional style of layout. To be creative, maybe I can display the content in a bolder way to bring my visitors new experience.
    </p>

    <p>W3school is a good place to learn something creative but I didn't realize this earlier. If I could make fuller use of the resources available here, more interesting elements will appear on my website.</p>
