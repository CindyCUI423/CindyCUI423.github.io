    <p id="greeting">This is Xinyi and welcome to my wonderland!</p>
    <p class="text"> I am currently doing a master's degree in computing at Australian National University. 
    One thing about me that you might find special is that I studied journalism at Ocean University of China as an undergraduate in the past 4 years. It's a huge change, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p class="text"> Studying journalism has exposed me to video shooting and editing, which I later luckily found to be my passion. 
    During the 4 years of my undergraduate study, I produced over 20 videos, including documentaries, microfilms, commercials, etc. 
    These videos may not be masterpieces, but I had a lot of fun in the process of creating them. 
    These are the reasons why I want to build this website—to show my video works and share the stories behind them.
